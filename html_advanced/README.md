In this and coming projects, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:

Page in Figma
fig file
And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md
